            <p>
                Linux is an open-source <b>Unix-like</b> operating system, based on the linux kernel
                mostly packaged as a Linux distribution or <i>distro</i>. It was built by <b>Linus Torvalds</b> in 'C' and 'assembly' language and is being maintained by this 'awesome' community of open-source enthusiasts. Released on <b>September 17, 1991</b>, is in working state and is used widely. 
                <blockquote>
                    <i>The <b>Linux kernel</b> is a free and open-source, monolithic, Unix-like operating system kernel. The Linux family of operating systems is based on this kernel and deployed on both traditional computer systems such as personal computers and servers, usually in the form of Linux distributions.
                    </i>

                Linux is the dominant OS in cloud, in IoT, and on mobile. 
                And while it might not have “won” the desktop war (yet) there’s no denying that its 
                collaborative, freely available nature has had a major influence its 
                competitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Linux also runs on embedded systems, i.e. devices whose operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system. This includes routers, automation controls, televisions, digital video recorders, video game consoles,and smartwatches. Many smartphones and tablet computers run Android and other Linux derivatives.

            <h5>
                Open Source Platform
            </h5>
            <blockquote>
                Linux, because you will know your system from outside to under the hood. The transparency of the operating system is the key factor what makes it different.
            </blockquote>
            <h5>Security</h5>
            <blockquote>Though the number of peronal computers using Windows is large, yet the systems are proned to different types of attacks and thus, are vulnerable. The level of security is this much high that one won't need to install an antivirus program. It's just the matter of how the Linux system works.
            </blockquote>
            <h5>Customization</h5>
            <blockquote>This is the era of Customization. This feature really makes Linux distros stand-out. If you like playing and tweaking the interface then linux is there for you. There are a number of Dekstop Environments(DEs) which are highly customizable and are maintained actively provided with cool themes made by people.</blockquote>
            <h5>Varied Flavours</h5>
            <blockquote>As said in the very first paragraph only, Linux OSs are packaged as distros. The number of distros availble out there is 'much'.</blockquote>
            <h5>Applications</h5>
            <blockquote>
                There is a large support for many applications and there are binaries and packages that can be downloaded and installed onto a linux system. There are still some applications that are only windows made. For that <br/><h4>WINE <img src="./images/wine.png" alt="WINE" height="40">(WINE Is Not an Emulator)</h4> package can be installed so that an environment can be settled to run an app. That makes it possile for you to play or run Windows games and apps.
            </blockquote>
            <h5>Highly Reliable</h5>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                When using linux, one doesn't need to worry about rebooting everytime an update is installed. It is neither slowed down, nor gives annoying alerts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reliability is one of the key factors why most of the servers run Linux.
            </p>
            </blockquote>
            <h5>Privacy</h5>
            <blockquote>This is the time where your data is an asset for others. Feel secure when using Linux as it collects no data. Moreover, one won't be needing additional tools for protecting their privacy.</blockquote>
            <h4 id="impact">Impact on the society</h4>
            <p>
                Stated before also, the <b>majority of the web runs on linux</b>. Due to it's flexibility, OSs like Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo, etc are powering most of the web. Network administrators love Linux because it can be customized to a network’s specific needs, and is capable of running single and multiple tasks without a lot of background processes clogging up the system. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Most of the smart - App enabled televisions and appliances run on Linux.</b> The reason is so that the manufacturers can create their tailored TV User Interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                The very famous mobile OS - <b>Android is also based on Linux.</b> This operating system powering so many phones and tablets around the world is actually derived from a Linux kernel. Linux is also the primany foundation of <b>ChromeOS.</b> Many computer manufacturers have started to develop their own OS.
            </p>
            <p>
                Linux is heaven for all developers out there. With strong community support and wide usage, there are many libraries. This is the perfect environment for developing software and apps. There is full support for most of the programming languages. One can totally feel the bash scripting power.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also demand for Linux as a skill - from server management to help building the cloud services.
            </p>
            <h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
            <p>
                Summarizing everything, one can not deny the fact that Linux is flexible for every situation. It fulfills the needs of a normal user and also the one who needs a cool working environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Linux based OSs are playing their roles in every field - from homes to the clouds and all the applications. The rich variety is free to all. The build of Linux is so that you can focus on your work rather than burning oil for tackling security issues and protecting your private information.
